# -Churn-Prediction
Used Pythonâ€™s Scikit Learn to solve the churn prediction problem using th emethod of Ensemble stacking. The datasets has both categorical and numeric variables.
Classification methods to predict churn:
1. Multi-layer Perceptron 
2. Support Vector Machines 
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest

Hyperparameter Tuning and Smote performed to balance.
